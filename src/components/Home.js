          I'm so happy you made it to my site!</h2>
          <h3>My name is Aleks and I am a fullstack  software engineer with a keen eye for design.</h3>
          <p>I am an artist by nature and a web developer by training. Art and tech, for me, is a perfect union,- two elements that fulfill and complement one another.
          I love to learn new things, no matter how tough, and I love to teach others (no matter how tough).
          Generally, I like rolling up my sleeves and getting scrappy.
          I currently live, climb, and build apps in Brooklyn, New York.
