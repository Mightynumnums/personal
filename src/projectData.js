    description: `Anbe Baccam is an emerging photographer. When I was building his website, I really wanted to showcase his work in a simple way. It was important to me, to let the beauty of his work to speak for itself, without too much disruption or noise. This website is the first that I've ever built. It uses HTML and CSS, with some small amount of JavaScript and JQuery. Working on it made me fall in love with programming. It helped me understand how my passion for design and illustration fit together with tech.`,

    description: `Happy Bones is a small coffee shop that is located smack in the middle of SOHO, Little Italy and China Town. I used to work at Happy Bones as a manager and a barista for 3 years. There was a period of time, when HB was growing rapidly, but for some reason was missing a website. I volunteered to build a prototype, because I loved the shop and I also recently fell in love with web development.`,
